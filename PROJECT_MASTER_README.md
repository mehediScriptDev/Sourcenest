**Version**: 0.1.6  
**Status**: 🚀 Active Development

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST!

This README is the **single source of truth** for the entire project. Every AI agent must:

1. ✅ **Read this file FIRST** before making any changes
2. ✅ **Check page/API status** before starting work
3. ✅ **Update this file** when adding/removing pages or APIs
4. ✅ **Mark progress** in the API Integration TODO
5. ✅ **Document changes** so work can be picked up if an agent fails

**If you're here because a previous agent stopped**: Check the "🚦 Current Status" section and "API Integration TODO" to understand what's in progress.

## 📞 COMMON COMMANDS

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build           # Build for production
pnpm start           # Start production server
pnpm lint            # Run ESLint
pnpm type-check      # Check TypeScript compilation

# Database/Migration (if applicable)
# [Add your database commands here]

# Testing
pnpm test            # Run tests
pnpm test:watch     # Watch mode
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### ⛔ DO NOT
- ❌ Delete or modify files in `/lib/api/client.ts` without approval
- ❌ Change authentication flow without updating `/lib/auth-context.tsx`
- ❌ Hardcode API endpoints (use apiClient)
- ❌ Create duplicate components (check `/components/ui` first)
- ❌ Ignore TypeScript errors
- ❌ Commit directly to main branch

### ✅ DO
- ✅ Ask for permission before major changes
- ✅ Update this README for all page/API changes
- ✅ Use existing patterns and components
- ✅ Document your work as you go
- ✅ Test in browser before committing
- ✅ Check for similar implementations first

## 📋 NOTES & COMMENTS

### 🔴 SUSPENDED/DISABLED FEATURES

**User Suspend Button**
- Date: May 5, 2026

- Types should be added to `/lib/typzh.ts`

### ⏰ RECENT CHANGES

**May 5, 2026**:
- Commented out Suspend button in Users admin page
- Created AI Agent README guide
- Created this Master README
